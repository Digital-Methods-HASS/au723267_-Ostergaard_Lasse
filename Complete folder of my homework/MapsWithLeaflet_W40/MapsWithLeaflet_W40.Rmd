# Task 1: Create a Danish equivalent of AUSmap with esri layers, 

The map needs to be called DANmap 


Loading the right packages 
```{r loading the right packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(leaflet)
library(htmlwidgets)
```



Set the location and zoom level
```{r location and zoom}
leaflet() %>% 
  setView(9.6883882,56.0800343, zoom = 10) %>%
  addTiles()  # checking I am in the right area

```

Bring in a choice of esri background layers 

Creating a basic map
```{r basic map}
l_ssk <- leaflet() %>%   # assign the base location to an object
  setView(9.6883882,56.0800343, zoom = 15)
```

Select backgrounds from among provider tiles. To view them the options, go to https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/
```{r selecting backgrounds}
esri <- grep("Esri", providers, value = TRUE)
```

```{r}
for (provider in esri) {
  l_ssk <- l_ssk %>% addProviderTiles(provider, group = provider)
}
```


We have chosen to make a map of Skt Sørens Kilde, Danmark
We make a layered map out of the components above and write it to an object called DANmap
```{r map of Skt Sørens Kilde}
DANmap <- l_ssk %>%
  addLayersControl(baseGroups = names(esri),
                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)) %>%
  addMiniMap(tiles = esri[[1]], toggleDisplay = TRUE,
             position = "bottomright") %>%
  addMeasure(
    position = "bottomleft",
    primaryLengthUnit = "meters",
    primaryAreaUnit = "sqmeters",
    activeColor = "#3D535D",
    completedColor = "#7D4479") %>% 
  htmlwidgets::onRender("
                        function(el, x) {
                        var myMap = this;
                        myMap.on('baselayerchange',
                        function (e) {
                        myMap.minimap.changeLayer(L.tileLayer.provider(e.name));
                        })
                        }") %>% 
  addControl("", position = "topright")

DANmap
```

## Reading in the data from Google sheets
We are reading in the data of the different danish attractions. Afterwards we can then add the markers to the map
```{r loading data from sheets}
gs4_deauth()
places <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PlxsPElZML8LZKyXbqdAYeQCDIvDps2McZx1cTVWSzI/edit#gid=124710918",
                     range="DigitalMethods",
                     col_types = "cccnncnc")

glimpse(places)
```
The google sheets document includes different ranges from different years. By calling it "DigitalMethods"
we make sure that we are using the range called DigitalMethods which includes the attractions that we have written down.

# Adding markers to the map 
Next up we add the markers to the map. That means that the different attractions will show up on the map of Denmark
```{r adding markers}
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description)
```


# Task 2  Read in the googlesheet data you and your colleagues populated with data into the DANmap object you created in Task 1
```{r adding data to DANmap}
DANmap %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description)
```

# Task 3 - Clustering the markers together 
To cluster the markers together means that when you zoom out, the markers will turn in to a cluster in the area in which they are situated

When clustering you use the clusterOptions function
```{r clustering}
DANmap %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```

# Task 4 considering what the map is good for and what it isn't good for 
 Its good if you want a map of where different danish attractions are placed and if you want a map where a small description is provided as well. The map doesn't provide information that seems useful in a more in depth analysis. The map shouldn't be used as a map for navigation either. It could be a bit more descriptive, for instance there is a place near Herning that says: a place where you by rocks. That doesn't give a great description for readers who want to know what the different attractions offer. 
 
# Task 5 find out how to display classifications and notes on the map
To display classifications and notes we have to load the right packages 
```{r packages}
library(htmltools)
```


```{r finished DANmap}
DANmap %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = places$Longitude,
             lat = places$Latitude, 
             radius = places$Stars1_5 * 3 ,
             weight = 10,
             color = "red",
             label = places$Placename,
             popup = paste("Placenames:", places$Placename,
                           "<br>Coordinates:", places$Longitude, ",", places$Latitude,
                           "<br>Type:", places$Type,
                           "<br>Description:", places$Description,
                           "<br>Stars:", places$Stars1_5))
```


Here we have used the addCircleMarkers function to add circles and then ranged them by the stars recieved in the google sheets. The popup = paste function is used for adding more mulitple line labels to the markers. I've also added som extra touches to the map by including a new color for the circles, as well as adding a label, so that the name of place shows when hovering over it with your mouse 

The finished map gives a more detailed view of the attractions. The map adds more description than the maps above. The sizes of the circles give a view of the stars that the attractions has recieved, which is good if you quickly want to see which attractions to visit.
